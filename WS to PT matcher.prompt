# PROBLEMPROMPT
TASK: Problem Template Matching

## OBJECTIVE
Compare each question in a provided worksheet against Problem Templates (PTs) to identify matching templates based on strict criteria.

## CRITERIA
REQUIRED MATCHING CONDITIONS:
1. Concept Alignment: Must address same mathematical concept
2. Difficulty Parity: Must maintain equivalent difficulty level
3. Given Values: Must have identical number of given values
4. Process Matching: Must follow same problem-solving approach
5. Context Consistency:
   - Both must be contextual (real-world) or both non-contextual
   - NO mixed context/non-context matches permitted

## OUTPUT SPECIFICATION
FORMAT: Markdown table with columns:
| Question Number | PT# (just the number, no PT infront of the number) | Justification |

REQUIREMENTS:
- Justification must explicitly validate all matching criteria
- Use "no match" for non-matching items with specific reason
- Example valid match:
  "Q19 ↔ 62906: Both contextual 2-step decimal multiplication with price calculations"

## OPERATIONAL PROTOCOL
1. ACKNOWLEDGE receipt of worksheet and PT PDF
2. REQUEST CLARIFICATION for any ambiguities
3. EXECUTE comparison using exact criteria
4. VALIDATE each match against all conditions
5. DELIVER formatted output table

## EXAMPLES
VALID MATCH:
Q12 ↔ 62845: Both contextual single-step weight conversion with 2 given values

INVALID MATCH:
Q15 ↔ 62911: Rejected - Worksheet has context but PT is abstract

NO MATCH:
Q08: No matching PT (reason: no templates with 4 given volume values)

## COMPLIANCE
STRICT ADHERENCE REQUIRED to:
- Worksheet as reference standard
- Criteria hierarchy (all conditions must pass)
- Context parity rule
